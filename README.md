# Welcome

Welcome to my dotfiles repo!

This repo is a massive WIP

## Usage

To install my dotfiles and all tools/programs

```bash
git clone "https://github.com/joshslawrence/dotfiles"
cd dotfiles
bash setup_linux.sh full
```

To install my dotfiles only (omit `full` when running the shell script)

```bash
git clone "https://github.com/joshslawrence/dotfiles"
cd dotfiles
bash setup_linux.sh
```
